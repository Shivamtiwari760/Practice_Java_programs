//Define a string.
//Convert the string into lowercase to make the comparison insensitive.
//Split the string into words.
//Two loops will be used to find duplicate words. Outer loop will select a word and Initialize variable count to 1. Inner loop will compare the word selected by outer loop with rest of the words.
//If a match found, then increment the count by 1 and set the duplicates of word to '0' to avoid counting it again.
//After the inner loop, if count of a word is greater than 1 which signifies that the word has duplicates in the string.
